# JCS_UnityObject

Interface handle between multiple type of Unity Engine's declare type of gameobject.
This class makes sure each gameobject will still use the same variable name.

For instance, if you want to enable/disable an gameobject. By using this interface
you do not need to know what exactly the component you are trying to enable
/disable. You can just call `GetComponent<JCS_UnityObject>().LocalEnable = true;`
instead of trying to identify the component type and change the specific variable
from its component.
