| Direction                | Returns vector direction by passing the vector direction enum.              |
| ApplyRandVector3         | Add random value to a vector.                                               |
| GetFinalLocalEulerAngles | Get the final local euler angles by accumilate all the parent game objects. |
| GroundVector             | Make the vector to a ground vector.                                         |
| LookDegree               | How close player looks toward the target.                                   |
