* **Check Variables** - Variable only for checking, do not adjust the value of the variables, but you can use to check to see the effect during runtime.
* **Initialize Variables** - Variable only being use in game initialize time, set these kind of variable before hitting play button in order to get the result.
* **Runtime Variables** - Variable will work on both initialize time and runtime, you can adjust the variable during runtime and see the effect.
* **Helper Variables** - Variable only happens in developer mode, so it won't exist in the final build. Usually the helper tool in for level designer.
