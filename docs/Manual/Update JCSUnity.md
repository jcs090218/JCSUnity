# Update JCSUnity

We recommend you to delete the entire `JCSUnity` folder inside Unity editor.
Unity usually works well by finding the correct component links between
each assets.

1. Open up your project with Unity
2. Delete the entire `JCSUnity` folder (with Unity editor)
3. Import the latest/targeted JCSUnity version

You can find all our releases in our [release page](https://github.com/jcs090218/JCSUnity/releases).
