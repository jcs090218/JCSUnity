JCSUnity is a component driven Framework built to allow the user
to quickly generate commonly used game mechanics and features such
as UI functionality and player movement. This will allow for a
faster initial development. Most components work individually
while other components must be used in tandem with others.
Individually components can be combined to create new behaviors.
