# Running Crush

1) Create New Scene.
You can use "RC_Level_01" as the base level.

2) Effect Object
    - Effect Object uses Collider + Rigidbody to detect.
    - Set Variables, all effect as the name. (Direct Name, it should be clear enough.)

3) Effect Item
    - Object uses Effect Object class to do the effect, 
    but different than object. Player will have to pick the item
    up in order to get the effect.

4) [IMPORTANT] RC_GameSetting have the basic setting of 
  the whole game.

5) Tips:
    - Save a copy of the game before u do any changes or undo (Crtl + z).
    - Save the demo and compare the differences.
    - Ask ur programmer. (Name on top of this doc)

              ** Happy Level Design !!!~ **
