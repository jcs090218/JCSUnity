JCSUnity is a component driven framework built to allow the user
to quickly generate commonly used game mechanics and features
such as UI functionality and player movement. This will allow
for a faster initial development. Most components work individually
while other components must be used in tandem with others.
Individually components can be combined to create new behaviors.
